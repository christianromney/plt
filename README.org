*  What is this?

This repository contains my solutions to exercises from various programming
books, including:

- [[https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/little-schemer-fourth-edition][The Little Schemer]]
- [[https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/seasoned-schemer-second-edition][The Seasoned Schemer]]
- [[https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reasoned-schemer-second-edition][The Reasoned Schemer]]
- [[http://the-little-prover.github.io/][The Little Prover]]
- [[http://thelittletyper.com/][The Little Typer]]
- [[http://www.eopl3.com/][Essentials of Programming Languages]]
- [[https://www.htdp.org/][How to Design Programs]]
- [[https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html][Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)]]

I don't always work every exercise, so you won’t find a complete set of
solutions to compare with your answers if you’re working through the same
material. However, if you think you’ve got a better solution to something I’ve
cooked up, please open an issue and point me to your implementation.

I hope you get as much enjoyment and enlightenment from studying these works as
I have.
