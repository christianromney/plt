## What is this?

This repository contains my Scheme (Racket) solutions to exercises from various books for learning Lisp/Scheme. I'm currently working through The Little Schemer and The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP). I plan to subsequently work through The Seasoned Schemer and How to Design Programs (HTDP).

## What will I find here?

Some solutions to the exercises in the books mentioned above. I don't usually work every exercise, so this repository is unlikely to interest anyone looking for a complete set of solutions to reference as they work through the same material. However, if you're piecing together such a work and find something you want to use here, be my guest.
